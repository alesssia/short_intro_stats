# STATS 101: A short introduction to statistics 

Material for the short (9h) *"Stats 101"* course for medical residents I'm delivering at UniTO. 

Slides include teacher notes, which are in Italian (the language I'm delivering the course in).
The Italian notes are full of typos and often nonsensical. They will be eventually fixed :) 


## Topics covered

- How to sample from a population
- How to use measure of centrality and dispersion
- How to make estimation from a sample
- How to interpret confidence intervals
- How to make and test hypotheses

## Schedule

The course will be delivered in three days, each with 3h of frontal lesson with exercises.
